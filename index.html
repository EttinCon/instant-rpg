This is a role-playing game for 2 or more people, requiring no dice or paper, using <em>Rock/Paper/Scissors</em> to resolve uncertain outcomes.
</p>
<p>
	One player runs the game (<em><a href="#HowToRun">swipe for more</a></em>), the others play characters in a story which you tell together.
</p>
<p>
When the player running the game challenges you with <em>Rock/Paper/Scissors</em>, there are 3 possible outcomes:
</p>
<p>
If you <strong>win</strong>, you get what you want. Something good happens for you and your friends.
</p>
<p>
If you <strong>tie</strong>, you get what you want, but something bad happens to you, your fellow players, or just in general.
</p>
<p>
If you <strong>lose</strong>, you don’t get what you want, and something really bad happens.
</p>
<p>
To start the game, players answer the following questions, alongside any clarifying questions which the answers may inspire:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
	Where do you imagine we are?
        </li>        
        <li>
Why do you imagine we are here?
	</li>        
        <li>    
Who do you imagine trying to stop us?	
	</li>              
      </ul>

<strong>Rock the Boat.</strong> When a player tries something risky or introduces a story element, challenge them with <em>Rock/Paper/Scissors</em>, describing the results.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Share the Spotlight.</strong> Give everyone equal opportunity to contribute to the story. Choose a new player, then ask them:
</p>
<p>
<strong>“What do you do?”</strong> 
The most important question you can ask. When you finish describing things, always ask someone else <em>“What do you do?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Never Say No.</strong> If you think it doesn’t fit in the story, challenge them. Stop the game if needed. It’s much more important to keep friendships than to play a silly game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Go Wild.</strong> The stories one can tell with *INSTANT RPG* are very short (<em>an hour at most</em>), so the story will 
(<em>and should</em>) go off the rails.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Champion the Players.</strong> They lead the story. Celebrate their victories & lament their failures, you are gathered here to watch a story unfold before your very eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bowing Out.</strong> When you decide to stop playing (<em>or must</em>), describe a satisfactory ending or a tantalising cliffhanger!
